# Axelerant: Front-end Interview

### **==================================**
The code has been written using **Angular(v8)**, which supports Typescript(3.4). The UI components as well as the grid-based layout has been build with **FlexBox**, is written in **SCSS**.
#### Please note

- Direct access from here: [visit](https://shubham-negi.github.io)
- Make sure you've atleast **node 10.x** and **angular 8.x** installed to run this project 
- Find Web accessibility reports in **/a11y** directory
- Find desktop view and mobile view screenshots under **/screenshot**
### **==================================**

### Background

This exercise is to test your Front-end skills. You have to take the following [designs](./designs) and convert them to a website.

### Before you start

- Review the designs shared with you.
- Break the components as per [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).
  - Following the same pattern Sass can be broken into partials that can be placed in `sass` directory. For naming classes follow [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) and [BEM](http://getbem.com/).
- Please avoid using Bootstrap, Foundation, or similar CSS frameworks

- Login to Codesandbox using the `Sign in with GitHub` button on the top right corner.

- You can start working on the implementation as per designs
- To update the markup update the `index.html` file
- You can write styles in `src/sass/styles.scss` and create new partials in that directory.
- You can add JS in `src/js/index.js`

#### But I want to use a framework like React/Angular?

- Feel free to do so!
- Create a new sandbox on Codesandbox with your framework of choice

#### Brownie Points for:

- Showcasing use of CSS Grids and Flex
- Addressing a11y issues
- Keeping things performant

### Submission

- After you are done with the exercise share the link to your forked sandbox to us.
